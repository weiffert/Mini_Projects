# Mini_Projects
These are practice problems in a variety of languages that I intend to do on a weekly basis. I want to implement each solution in a variety of languages to retain skill in that area, and hopefully develop some more as well. Some problems are rather trivial; however, I want to apply concepts learned in CS 251, data structures and algorithms. Furthermore, I want to try to extend the problems with providing interfaces with web technologies. Occaisonally, a project might exceed the scope of _mini_, and will be given its own repository.

## Done
Nothing yet. Hopefully this will be filled soon.
